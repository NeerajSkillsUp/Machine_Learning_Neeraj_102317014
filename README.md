🎯 Purpose & Highlights

Emphasis on building a strong foundation in data handling and preprocessing — the initial assignments lay groundwork using NumPy and cleaning/data transformation techniques.

Introduction to model evaluation and robustness — via cross-validation, optimization, and dimensionality reduction.

Handling real-world data sourcing — through web scraping techniques to gather data when no dataset is available.

End-to-end exposure — from raw data to a working ML model — helping learners understand all stages of a typical ML project.
